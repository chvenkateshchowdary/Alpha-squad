### We had created a login and registration page so that only authenticated users can access the service.
### The user can create an account if he is a new user. If the user had an account, he can login using the credentials.
### Once the user logins, the page asks the user to upload an image.
### Once the image is uploaded, you can classify the image by clicking the classify button.
### On clicking the classify button, the call to the google Vision API invokes and fetches the json data for the image uploaded.
### The json data contains all the information regarding the image, the data is parsed accordingly and the required information will be displayed.
